# Rewinder

A tool for retrieving audio in the past.

Ever felt like, I need to remember that discussion which happened 10 min back. Now you can!

## Rewind and get audio

```shell
rewinder rewind 10 # to get 10 minutes of audio
```

## Start the daemon on startup

```shell
rewinder daemon
```

### Credits

Shamelessly copied the idea from [backtrack](https://backtrack.team/). Loved the idea, but unfortunately did not find
an alternative for linux. So, I hacked on one over a sunday. Eventually I plan on making an
elementary OS desktop app too.
